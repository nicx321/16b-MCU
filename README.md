# 16b-MCU
#### 16b MCU with IDE for logisim evolution
This is basic CPU with basic functions. You can use integrated IDE for help on usage and creating programs. You can also use integrated IDE for other architectures, you just have to add folder "Version_?" where ? specifies version 0-9 is recommender but A-Z and a-z should work too. Inside that folder you need a "exa.nxa" this file should contain Example code. "Help.txt" This should have Help (Unexpected...). And "Comp.py", This is compiling script which will be called after pressing compile button. Input should be read from "Input.txt" and saved to "Output.txt", after this, script should return number 1234 as mark of good execution of compile script.
